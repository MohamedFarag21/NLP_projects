This was a challenge introduced by Zindi website for text classification. I am not a big fan of nlp, thus i decided to have this as my first trial to deal with such a task.



# My insights

1- The data has many problems like the problem of having severe imbalanced classes - a cruical problem - that needed to be treated.

2- Using pandas to check sanity of data, I got a lot of observations like: data types mis-match and one of the categories needed to be corrected.

3- The text needed to be cleaned.

# My Approach

1- Data visualization and investigation.

2- Category encoding using pandas.

3- Using DL as a solution for the problem.

4- For imbalance, I used cost-sensitive approach to penalize the model more when it comes to minor classes.

Final comment, maybe the solution seems to be naive or unprofessional, but as i said this is my first project in NLP. ^^



If the solution is interesting, please star!
