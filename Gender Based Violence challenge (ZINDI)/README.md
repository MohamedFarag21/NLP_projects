This was a challenge introduced by Zindi website for text classification. I am not a big fan of nlp, thus this my first trial to deal with such a task.

# My insights

1- The data has many problems like the problem of having severe imbalanced classes - a cruical problem - that needed to be treated.

2- Using pandas to check sanity of data, I got a lot of observations like: data types mis-match and one of the categories needed to be lowered.

3- The text needed to be cleaned.
